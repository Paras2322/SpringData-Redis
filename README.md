## Introduction

This project serves as a template for building RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, with Redis cache integration for monitoring cache performance and SLF4J logging for better application logging.

## Features

- Implementation of RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Integration with Redis cache for caching frequently accessed data.
- Monitoring of Redis cache performance for better optimization.
- Logging using SLF4J for effective application logging.

## Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Redis
- SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the application properties file with your Redis server details.
3. Build and run the project using Maven or your preferred IDE.
4. Access the API endpoints using a REST client or web browser.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Paras2322/SpringData-Redis.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd project-directory
    ```

4. Build the project:

    ```
    mvn clean package
    ```

5. Run the application:

    ```
    java -jar target/application.jar
    ```

## Configuration

Update the `application.properties` file with your Redis server details, including host, port, and any authentication credentials if required.

## Monitoring Redis Cache

You can monitor Redis cache performance using Redis monitoring tools such as RedisInsight or by enabling Redis monitoring in your Redis server configuration.

## Logging with SLF4J

This project uses SLF4J for logging.
